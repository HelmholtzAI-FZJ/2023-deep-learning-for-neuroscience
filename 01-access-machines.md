## Communication:

- Zoom: [TODO]
- Slack: [TODO]

---

## Goals for this course:

- Make sure you know how to access and use our machines
- Distribute your ML workload.

### What is a supercomputer?

- Compute cluster: Many computers bound together locally
- Supercomputer: A damn lot of computers bound together locally

---

### Anatomy of a supercomputer

-  Login Nodes: Normal machines, for compilation, data transfer,  scripting, etc. No GPUs.
- Compute Nodes: Guess what :-)
- Network file system
- Scratch file system accessible from compute nodes
- Key stats:
    - Number of Nodes
    - CPUs, Number of Cores, Single-core Performance
    - RAM
    - Network: Bandwidth, Latency
    - Accelerators (e.g. GPUs)

---

### JUWELS Booster

- 936 Nodes
- AMD EPYC Rome 7402 CPU 2.7 GHz (2 Ã— 24 cores x 2 SMT threads = 96 virtual cores/node)
- 512 GiB memory
- Network Mellanox HDR infiniband (FASTðŸ’¨ and EXPENSIVEðŸ’¸)
- 4x NVIDIA A100 with 40gb.

TL;DR: 89856 cores, 3744 GPUs, 468 TB RAM ðŸ’ª

### Supercomputer Usage Model
- Using the the supercomputer means submitting a job to a batch system.
- No node-sharing. The smallest allocation for jobs is one compute node (4 GPUs).
- Maximum runtime of a job: 24h. Please implement checkpointing; or make your code faster ðŸ˜‰.
- Solution for long-running tasks: Job arrays.

### Connecting to JUWELS BOOSTER

#### Getting compute time
- Go to [http://judoor.fz-juelich.de](http://judoor.fz-juelich.de)
- Join the course project
- Compute time allocation is based on compute projects. For every compute job, a compute project pays.

``` {.java .number-lines}
// Some js

    a = 1;
    b = 2;
    let c = x => 1 + 2 + x;
    c(3);

```

```python
n = 0
while n < 10:
  if n % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{n} is even")
  else:
    print(f"{n} is odd")
  n += 1
```
