### JÃ¼lich Supercomputers

## I/O is separate and shared

#### All compute nodes of all supercomputers see the same files

- Performance tradeoff between shared acessibility and speed

## Data loading

## Strategies

- We have CPUs and lots of memory - let's use them
- Use big files made for parallel computing - HDF5, Zarr, mmap()
- Use specialized data loading libraries
- Compression - data throughput can be slower than time to decompression (must be checked case by case)

## Libraries

- FFCV [https://github.com/libffcv/ffcv](https://github.com/libffcv/ffcv)
- Nvidia's DALI [https://developer.nvidia.com/dali](https://developer.nvidia.com/dali)
