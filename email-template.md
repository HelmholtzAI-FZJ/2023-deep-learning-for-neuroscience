What software is necessary for this course?

The course can be followed by a Windows user, but if possible, avoid it. In general. Forever.

- Visual Studio Code: it's a free editor which we will demo on this course. Get it from https://code.visualstudio.com/download

- Visual Studio Code Remote Development: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack

- Visual Studio: Remote - SSH: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh

- (WINDOWS ONLY): WSL. This installs the WSL support for Visual Studio Code, which will install WSL itself (And Ubuntu). https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl - This is a long install, take your time.

- A terminal. On Linux and Mac, it's just called "Terminal". Little familiarity with it is required. On windows, the WSL installs it.

- The `ssh` command. It's installed by default on Mac and Linux, and should be on Windows after the aforementioned steps.

- Some knowledge of the python language.
